## Hi there 👋  
I’m **Krishna Murari**

### 💡 Junior Research Fellow | Mechanical Engineering

I work on **vibration isolation and low-frequency dynamics**, with an emphasis on analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental validation. I’m interested in mechanical systems that behave counter-intuitively—and in building models that explain why.
